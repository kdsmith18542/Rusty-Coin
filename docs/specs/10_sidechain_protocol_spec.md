Rusty Coin Formal Protocol Specifications: 10 - Developer & Tooling Ecosystem
Spec Version: 1.0.0
Status: Draft
Last Updated: June 18, 2025
Author(s): Rusty Coin Core Team

Dependencies: 00_overview.md, All core protocol specifications (e.g., 01_block_structure.md for data types, 07_networking_api_spec.md for RPC).

10.1 Overview
A thriving developer and tooling ecosystem is critical for the adoption, growth, and long-term sustainability of the Rusty Coin network. This document formally outlines the strategy for building comprehensive documentation, developer tools, and user-facing applications to facilitate interaction with the rustyd full node and the broader Rusty Coin protocol. The goal is to lower the barrier to entry for developers and users alike.

10.2 Documentation Suite
Clear, comprehensive, and up-to-date documentation is a cornerstone of a healthy ecosystem.

10.2.1 Rustdoc API Reference:

Purpose: Provides auto-generated, in-code documentation for all public and internal Rust APIs.

Requirement: All public functions, structs, enums, and modules within every crate (rusty-core, rusty-consensus, rusty-p2p, etc.) MUST be thoroughly documented using Rustdoc comments. This includes examples where applicable.

Automation: Rustdoc generation MUST be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline, and the latest version hosted publicly.

10.2.2 The Rusty Coin Book (mdbook):

Purpose: A high-level, human-readable guide covering the architecture, core concepts, setup, and common development patterns for Rusty Coin.

Content:

Introduction to Rusty Coin philosophy and design principles.

Detailed guide to setting up and running a rustyd full node.

Explanations of OxideSync, FerrisScript, Masternodes, and their roles.

Developer guides for interacting with RPC, building transactions, and working with rusty-wallet crate.

Security best practices for users and developers.

Tooling: Maintained using mdbook for easy navigation and hosting.

10.2.3 Formal Protocol Specifications (docs/specs/):

Purpose: The definitive, unambiguous technical reference for all protocol rules and behaviors.

Requirement: All specifications (e.g., 01_block_structure.md, 02_oxidehash_pow_spec.md, etc.) MUST be kept up-to-date with the implemented protocol. Changes to the protocol MUST be reflected first in a draft specification before implementation.

Hosting: Publicly hosted and easily discoverable.

10.2.4 JSON-RPC API Reference:

Purpose: A complete and accurate documentation of all exposed JSON-RPC methods.

Content: For each method: method_name, parameters (type, required/optional, description), return_value (type, description), error_codes, example_request, example_response.

Tooling: Automatically generated from code annotations (if possible) or manually maintained using OpenAPI/Swagger or a similar standard for machine-readability.

10.3 Developer Tooling
Tools that simplify building on or integrating with Rusty Coin.

10.3.1 Client SDKs (Software Development Kits):

Purpose: Provide convenient interfaces for developers in popular programming languages to interact with rustyd nodes via the JSON-RPC API.

Target Languages: Initial focus on Python and JavaScript/TypeScript due to their broad adoption in blockchain scripting and web development.

Functionality:

RPC client wrappers (e.g., getblock, sendrawtransaction).

Transaction building helpers.

Key derivation and signing utilities.

Address generation and validation.

Basic UTXO management.

10.3.2 Command-Line Interface (CLI) Wallet (rusty-cli):

Purpose: A powerful, text-based wallet for advanced users, miners, and developers to manage RUST funds and interact with the node.

Foundation: Built directly using the rusty-wallet crate.

Functionality:

Wallet creation, import, export (seed phrase).

Address generation and management.

Balance checking (getbalance).

Sending/receiving RUST (standard TX, OxideSend).

Staking management (ticket purchase, status).

Masternode control (registration, status).

Raw transaction building and signing.

RPC access to rustyd node.

10.3.3 Testnet Faucet:

Purpose: Facilitate development and testing on the Public Testnet by providing free test $RUST.

Implementation: A simple web application or CLI tool that dispenses small amounts of test RUST to requested addresses.

Security: Implement basic rate limiting and captcha to prevent abuse.

10.4 User-Facing Applications
Applications that provide a user-friendly interface for managing RUST and interacting with the network.

10.4.1 Desktop Wallet (rusty-gui):

Purpose: A cross-platform graphical user interface (GUI) wallet for everyday users.

Technology: Leverage modern cross-platform frameworks (e.g., Tauri (Rust backend, web frontend), Electron, or a native Rust GUI framework like egui or iced). Tauri is preferred for its lightweight nature and Rust backend.

Functionality:

Intuitive UI for basic wallet operations (send, receive, balance).

Clear transaction history.

Visual staking and Masternode management.

Security settings (encryption, seed phrase backup, PQC migration prompts).

Integration of OxideSend and FerrousShield features.

10.4.2 Official Block Explorer:

Purpose: A web-based tool for transparently viewing all data on the Rusty Coin blockchain.

Backend: A robust backend service that connects to rustyd nodes (via JSON-RPC) to index and store blockchain data for fast querying.

Frontend: A responsive web interface for:

Searching blocks by height or hash.

Searching transactions by TxID.

Searching addresses for balances and transaction history.

Viewing real-time block and transaction feeds.

Displaying network statistics (hashrate, block time, PoS ticket count, active Masternodes, network map).

Visualizing state_root changes (advanced feature).

10.4.3 Hardware Wallet Integration (Long-Term):

Purpose: Provide the highest level of security for user funds.

Requirement: Collaborate with leading hardware wallet manufacturers (e.g., Ledger, Trezor) to integrate Rusty Coin support into their firmware and client software. This requires implementing Rusty Coin's specific transaction signing logic on the hardware device.

10.5 Community Engagement and Support
10.5.1 Developer Community Channels:

Requirement: Maintain active and moderated channels (e.g., Discord server, GitHub Discussions, dedicated forum) for developer Q&A, collaboration, and support.

10.5.2 Educational Content:

Requirement: Produce a continuous stream of tutorials, blog posts, videos, and FAQs explaining Rusty Coin's features, how to build on it, and how to use its tools.

10.5.3 Grant Programs (Future):

Requirement: Once the network is mature and governance is established, create a community-governed grant program to fund third-party projects that enhance the Rusty Coin ecosystem. This will incentivize external development.
