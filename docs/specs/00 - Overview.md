0.1 Introduction
This document, and the accompanying series of numbered markdown files, constitutes the Formal Protocol Specifications for the Rusty Coin ($RUST) blockchain. These specifications serve as the definitive, unambiguous technical reference for the Rusty Coin protocol.

They expand upon the high-level concepts and architectural overview provided in the "Rusty Coin: Extremely Detailed Technical Blueprint" by delving into the precise behavior, data structures, algorithms, and rules that govern the network's operation.

0.2 Purpose of these Specifications
The primary goals of these formal specifications are:

Eliminate Ambiguity: To define every aspect of the Rusty Coin protocol in a clear, concise, and unambiguous manner, ensuring consistent interpretation across all implementations.

Enable Verifiability: To provide a foundation for:

Rigorous manual code review.

Automated conformance testing (e.g., test vectors, state machine tests).

Potential formal verification (mathematical proofs of correctness) for critical components.

Facilitate Interoperability: To serve as the authoritative standard for:

Independent full node implementations (should any arise).

Development of third-party tooling (wallets, explorers, mining software).

Integration with external systems (e.g., exchanges, other blockchain protocols).

Enhance Security: By precisely defining expected behavior, these specifications aid in identifying and preventing deviations that could lead to vulnerabilities or exploits.

Support Long-Term Evolution: To act as a stable, versioned reference point for proposing and implementing future protocol upgrades through the on-chain governance (Homestead Accord).

Knowledge Transfer: To serve as a comprehensive resource for new core developers, researchers, and community members seeking in-depth understanding of the protocol.

0.3 Audience
These specifications are primarily intended for:

Rusty Coin Core Developers: The primary implementers of the rustyd full node.

Third-Party Developers: Building wallets, explorers, mining software, or other applications interacting with the Rusty Coin network.

Security Researchers & Auditors: Reviewing the protocol for vulnerabilities and economic soundness.

Blockchain Researchers: Studying hybrid consensus mechanisms, Rust-based blockchain implementations, or post-quantum cryptography integration.

Advanced Network Participants: Masternode operators and large-scale stakers seeking a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanics.

0.4 Relationship to Technical Blueprint
The "Extremely Detailed Technical Blueprint" provides a structured overview, outlining the "what" and high-level "how" of Rusty Coin. These Formal Specifications take the next step, defining the "how, precisely" and "what are the exact rules" for each component.

The Blueprint serves as an architectural guide.

These Specifications serve as the definitive contract for protocol behavior.

Developers are expected to consult these Formal Specifications for precise implementation details and protocol rules. Any discrepancies between the Blueprint and these Specifications, where found, should defer to the Specifications as the authoritative source.

0.5 Document Structure and Navigation
Each specification document is numbered and focused on a distinct component or protocol aspect. Readers are encouraged to start with this 00_overview.md and then navigate to specific sections as needed.

Dependencies: Each document may list its dependencies on other specification documents, indicating foundational concepts or data structures defined elsewhere.

Version Control: Each document is versioned independently to track changes and updates.

By adhering to these formal specifications, we aim to build a Rusty Coin network that is not only robust and secure but also transparent and truly decentralized.
