1. Vision & Philosophy

Rusty Coin ($RUST) is a peer-to-peer digital currency engineered for resilience, decentralization, and longevity. Following the "Homestead Model," it is a community-driven protocol with no treasury or pre-mine, where 100% of rewards are distributed to network participants. The entire codebase is written in Rust to leverage its guarantees of memory safety, concurrency, and performance, creating a provably robust foundation.
2. Core Architecture

    Language: Rust (2021 Edition or later).
    Node Implementation: A single, monolithic binary containing modular crates for distinct functions (consensus, networking, wallet, RPC). This simplifies deployment for users.
    Concurrency: Leverages Rust's async/await syntax with the tokio runtime for highly concurrent handling of P2P messaging, transaction processing, and RPC calls.
    Data Storage: A custom key-value store optimized for blockchain data (like LMDB or a custom implementation using RocksDB) for storing the blockchain state, UTXO set, and indexes.

3. Consensus Mechanism: Hybrid PoW/PoS

The consensus mechanism is designed to create a symbiotic relationship between miners and stakers.

    Proof-of-Work (PoW): Miners expend computational energy to find a valid block candidate.
        Hashing Algorithm: OxideHash (see section 4).
        Target Block Time: 2.5 minutes.
        Difficulty Adjustment: A weighted moving average (LWMA) difficulty adjustment algorithm will be used to respond smoothly to changes in network hashrate.
    Proof-of-Stake (PoS): Stakers provide finality and secondary validation.
        Staking Process: Users lock $RUST to purchase "voting tickets." The ticket price is adjusted dynamically by the protocol to target a constant pool of ~20,000 live tickets.
        Block Finalization: For a PoW block candidate to become a canonical part of the chain, it must be approved by a randomly selected quorum of 3 out of 5 voting tickets in the subsequent block.
        Security: This hybrid model means an attacker would need to control a majority of both the network hashrate and the active voting stake to reliably execute a 51% attack, making the cost of an attack prohibitively expensive.

4. Hashing Algorithm: OxideHash

OxideHash is a custom, memory-hard hashing algorithm designed to be ASIC-resistant and favor GPU miners, promoting decentralized hash power.

    Core Primitives: Uses the BLAKE3 hashing function internally for its exceptional speed.
    Mechanism:
        The block header is hashed with BLAKE3 to produce a 32-byte seed.
        This seed is used to deterministically generate a 1 GiB pseudo-random dataset called the "Scratchpad."
        The mining process involves executing a sequence of pseudo-random reads, additions, and rotations on data within the Scratchpad. The addresses for these reads are derived from previous results, preventing trivial parallelization.
        After millions of iterations, the final state is hashed one last time with BLAKE3 to produce the final block hash.

5. Masternode System

    Collateral: 26,000 $RUST.
    Proof-of-Service (PoSe): A challenge-response protocol where the network periodically pings masternodes. Failure to respond correctly and in a timely manner will temporarily disqualify the masternode from receiving rewards.
    Masternode Services:
        OxideSend (Instant Transactions): Utilizes masternode quorums to lock transaction inputs via LLMQ (Long-Living Masternode Quorums), providing transaction confirmation in under two seconds.
        FerrousShield (Privacy Protocol): A trust-minimized implementation of Chaumian CoinJoin, coordinated by masternodes, allowing users to mix their UTXOs to enhance privacy.

6. Governance Protocol: The Homestead Accord

Governance is conducted on-chain for protocol upgrades.

    Proposal: A developer submits a proposal as a special transaction.
    Voting Period: For a period of ~1 month (11,520 blocks), masternodes and stakers vote yes or no on the proposal.
    Threshold: A proposal is accepted if it maintains a supermajority (>75%) of "yes" votes.
    Activation: If accepted, the protocol change automatically activates after a ~1 month grace period, giving node operators time to update their software.

7. Networking & Cryptography

    P2P Protocol: Built on the libp2p framework, leveraging its modules for node discovery (Kademlia DHT), stream multiplexing, and NAT traversal.
    Message Serialization: Protocol Buffers (protobuf) for efficient, strongly-typed, and cross-language compatible network messages.
    Cryptography Suite:
        Digital Signatures: Ed25519 for standard transactions.
        General Hashing: BLAKE3.
        Wallet Standard: BIP39 (Mnemonic Phrases) and BIP32/BIP44 (Hierarchical Deterministic Wallets).

8. Additional Features for Longevity & Scalability

    Feature 1: Adaptive Block Size
    To avoid contentious debates about block size, the protocol will feature an adaptive limit. The maximum block size will be calculated based on a 3-month trailing average of the median block size, allowing it to grow organically with usage up to a hard-coded maximum cap. Any changes to the cap itself would require a governance vote.

    Feature 2: QuantumGuard Readiness
    The protocol will be designed to be "crypto-agile." While Ed25519 is the default signature scheme, the transaction format will include a version field allowing for a future hard fork to a quantum-resistant signature scheme. The leading candidate for this future upgrade is CRYSTALS-Dilithium, a NIST-selected post-quantum standard.

    Feature 3: Ferrite Sidechain Framework
    To enable advanced functionality without bloating the L1 chain, the masternode network will be empowered to run an optional sidechain validation module. This framework, Ferrite, will allow for the creation of pegged sidechains with different features (e.g., full EVM smart contract capability). The main $RUST chain will only need to track cryptographic state commitments from these sidechains, ensuring L1 remains lean and secure.
